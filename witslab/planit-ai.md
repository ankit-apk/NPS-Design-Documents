   AI features will be integrated contextually within the PlanIT UI, appearing as suggestions, automated actions, or analytical insights where users need them most.
   4.2. Detailed AI Feature Breakdown
   4.2.1. AI-Powered User Story Generation & Refinement
   Functionality:
   From Epic/Feature to Stories: Users input a high-level epic or feature description. AI generates a set of draft user stories (e.g., following "As a [user type], I want [goal] so that [reason]").
   Acceptance Criteria (AC) Suggestion: For a given user story, AI suggests a list of potential acceptance criteria.
   Story Decomposition: AI can suggest breaking down a large story into smaller, more manageable stories.
   INVEST Principle Check: Optionally, AI can analyze a story against INVEST criteria and suggest improvements.
   Persona-Driven Stories: If personas are defined in PlanIT, AI can tailor story language and goals accordingly.
   User Interaction: Button like "Generate Stories with AI" or "Suggest ACs." Generated content appears in an editor for review and modification.
   Value: Saves time, improves story quality and consistency, helps in thorough requirement gathering.
   4.2.2. Intelligent Ticket Generation & Augmentation
   Functionality:
   Task Breakdown: From a user story, AI suggests a list of development, QA, and other relevant tasks.

   Related Ticket Linking: Surfaces historically similar tickets, resolved issues, or relevant knowledge base entries within PlanIT.
   Potential Conflict Identification: Flags if a new story/task seems to contradict existing active work or defined project constraints.
   Impact Analysis (Basic): When a ticket is significantly changed (e.g., scope, priority), AI can highlight other tickets that might be directly impacted.
   User Interaction: Alerts/notifications for duplicates, suggestions for linking tickets in the ticket view, a dedicated "AI Analysis" panel.
   Value: Reduces redundant work, improves planning by highlighting dependencies, prevents conflicts, leverages past knowledge.
   4.2.4. AI-Assisted Estimation & Prioritization
   Functionality:
   Effort Estimation Suggestion: Based on historical data of similar tickets (complexity, type, description length, assignee experience if available), AI suggests story points or time estimates. Provides a range or confidence level.
   Priority Recommendation: AI suggests a priority level (e.g., Low, Medium, High, Critical) based on ticket content (keywords like "crash," "blocker," "UI glitch"), stated business value (if captured), dependencies, and comparison with similarly prioritized past tickets.
   User Interaction: AI suggestions appear next to estimation/priority fields. Users can accept or override.
   Value: More consistent estimations, data-driven prioritization, helps newer team members estimate better.
   4.2.5. Automated Summarization & Reporting Insights
   Functionality:
   Ticket Summary: Generate a concise summary of a ticket with a long description or extensive comment history.
   Epic/Sprint/Release Summary: AI generates a narrative summary of progress, key accomplishments, and remaining work for epics, sprints, or releases based on the status of associated tickets.
   Comment Thread Condensation: Summarize lengthy discussion threads within a ticket to quickly get the gist.
   User Interaction: "Summarize with AI" button on tickets, epics, sprint boards. Automated summaries in project overview dashboards.
   Value: Saves time in understanding complex items, facilitates quicker reporting, improves communication.
   4.2.6. Natural Language Querying for Project Data
   Functionality:
   Users can type natural language questions into a search bar or dedicated AI chat interface within PlanIT.
   Examples: "Show me all open bugs assigned to Alex in Project Phoenix," "What's the progress on the 'User Authentication' epic?", "Which tasks are blocked in the current sprint?"
   AI translates the query into a structured search and presents the results.
